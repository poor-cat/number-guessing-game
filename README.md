# number-guessing-game
This is just a simple game(nothing special) in python. Love to see peeps throwing pull requests on this repo. 

So lemme just tell, few things if anyone is keep to play this rubbish game.
Where ever you put this game on your computer, just keep that empty database.txt file with i, else it will show error.
This game has few things that could be made better(that's why i put this on github), so guys feel free to raise issues even if they very very very noob

:)
